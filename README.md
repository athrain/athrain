### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Great to see you on my GitHub profile!

## Just a few words about me 
I'm a Recruitment/Talent Acquisition Data Analyst based in Poland. I'm totally into analysing data from various sources, solving complex recruitment challenges and making TA Teams work better with the help of automations, scripting and well-prepared analyses.
I do specialise in Recruitment/People metrics - checking recruitment efficiency, quality of hires, identifying main bottlenecks, aligning on the data with finance/HR, figuring out solutions for integrating various systems to ensure data integrity and quality. **Want to learn more? Please reach out to me on LinkedIn.

## What you can find here 
Some scripts and Jupyter Notebooks that I use to conduct full ETL processess. You can use them if you want as well, but you have to customise them - it could be especially useful for you if you have some raw data in various files and you want to clean them up and e.g. load them onto DB.
Later on, you will find here some PowerBI reports and web crawlers - if I have enough spare time to prepare them outside work ðŸ“Š

### ðŸ§° In my daily work, I use:
- **Python 3.1x**-> as a primary scripting language to compare various files, analyse large sets of data (100k+ records) and do some small automations (sending mails, automating repetitive tasks etc.)
- **Pandas**- to analyse th data. Yup, I could find something that's faster or better-optimised for the datasets I do currently use. But it works fine, I know it and I keep getting better at it ðŸ™‚
- **Jupyter Notebook** (sometimes Google Colab) - to experiment with different approaches, try out new solutions and see exactly what I'm scripting.
- **PyCharm** - to prepare my scripts and test them in a more professional enviroment
- **Excel** - good, old Excel, which keeps suprising me how efficient it can be. Unless you have a table with 100k+ records. Then it crashes ðŸ¤¡ But seriously, if I want to make a fast analysis or tracker that could be almost entirely automated (with the support of some Python scripting) and used widely by various business leaders/stakeholders, it's great!
- **PowerBI** - a proper BI tool that I use to prepare all reorts, especially more sophisticated ones, to dive deeply into the analysis and tell the story with them.
- **DAX** - in addition to PowerBI, to make the calculations more accurate and adjust them to company's needs
- **PostgreSQL DB** - to store my data, in addition with Python scripts (and SQLAlchemy)
- **Git** - to keep everything in one place :)


ðŸŒ± Currently learning:
- **SQLAlchemy** - already did a few scripts with it and see it's great potential, but still some work ahead of me
- **Docker**
- **Adanced SQL**
- **Web scraping**

### Want to reach out to me?
I'm always happy to exchange knowledge and talk more about recruitment, process optimisations, data analysis, scripting! **Feel free to reach out me on LinkedIn (link in my profile)** or, if you're a sourcer - try to find my email address somewhere here ðŸ˜‰
