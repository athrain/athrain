### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Great to see you on my GitHub profile!

## Just a few words about me 
I'm a Recruitment/Talent Acquisition Data Analyst based in Poland. I'm totally into analysing data from various sources, solving complex recruitment challenges and making TA Teams work better with the help of automations, scripting and well-prepared analyses.
I do specialise in Recruitment/People metrics - checking recruitment efficiency, quality of hires, identifying main bottlenecks, aligning on the data with finance/HR, figuring out solutions for integrating various systems to ensure data integrity and quality. **Want to learn more? Please reach out to me on LinkedIn.**

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: I specialise in:
- People Analytics (recruiting, onboarding, offboarding, employee data) 
- Analytics/Dashboards/Visualizations (statistics, exploratory analysis, surveys, data storytelling, use of various BI tools) 
- Talent Intelligence (market mapping, analysis of publicly available data, web scraping, job board analysis, candidate databases) 
- Automation in HR/TA (scripts, internal tools, trackers) 
- Superuser/admin of ATS systems (experience with multiple systems such as Jobvite, Recruitee, Greenhouse, Teamtailor, SmartRecruiters, Workday, Lever, Workable)

## What you can find here 
Some scripts and Jupyter Notebooks that I use to conduct full ETL processess. You can use them if you want as well, but you have to customise them - it could be especially useful for you if you have some raw data in various files and you want to clean them up and e.g. load them onto DB.
Later on, you will find here some PowerBI reports and web crawlers - if I have enough spare time to prepare them outside work ðŸ“Š

### ðŸ§° In my daily work, I use:
- **Python 3.1x**
- **Pandas**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **PyCharm**
- **Excel**
- **PowerBI**
- **DAX**
- **PostgreSQL DB**
- **Git**
- **Selenium** (web scraping)


ðŸŒ± Currently learning:
- **SQLAlchemy** - already did a few scripts with it and see it's great potential, but still some work ahead of me
- **Docker**
- **Adanced SQL**

### Want to reach out to me?
I'm always happy to exchange knowledge and talk more about recruitment, process optimisations, data analysis, scripting! **Feel free to reach out me on LinkedIn (link in my profile)** or, if you're a sourcer - try to find my email address somewhere here ðŸ˜‰
